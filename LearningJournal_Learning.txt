Learning Learning Journal

There are couple different reasons why want to track our learning progress.
    We can go back and revise learned things
    See what type of learning works best for us
    Develop growth mindset
    Document the learning process for others
    We don't waste time trying to learn something all over against

The way I track my learning progress here is by keeping a earning journal. Besides that, there are also other methods of keeping track of learning:
    verbal
    hand-written
    electronic diary
        document
        web sites

Which one we decide to use will depend on couple of factors, one of which are our goals, our methods, the reason for learning, etc.

For each learning journal assignment, I will write down 5 things without referring the journal, 5 things with a journal, and 5 new things that I'm aware of that I can learn. Also, I will write how the coding practice might differ between professionals and beginners.

When we try to focus our learning, there are couple of things that can guide our focus during learning. Type of learning can depend on:
    Whether we're trying to memorize the content
    Learn a rule
    Make a habit
    etc.

Another step is also learning about and how to use technology. We can either figure it out ourselves or we can rely on experts. Which one we choose will depend on difficulty, correctness, or durability. Sometimes, the importance of learning will require of us to find an expert. There are couple ways how to find an expert.

Bloom's taxonomy - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy
Learning objectives can be classified in hierarchical model, called Bloom's taxonomy. It starts with the most basic and moves on to the more complicated. The levels are:
    Knowledge - involves recognizing or remembering facts, terms, basic concepts, or answers without necessarily understanding what they mean.
    Comprehension - involves demonstrating an understanding of facts and ideas by organizing, summarizing, translating, generalizing, giving descriptions, and stating the main ideas.
    Application - Application involves using acquired knowledge to solve problems in new situations. This involves applying acquired knowledge, facts, techniques and rules.
    Analysis - Analysis involves examining and breaking information into component parts, determining how the parts relate to one another, identifying motives or causes, making inferences, and finding evidence to support generalizations.
    Synthesis - Synthesis involves building a structure or pattern from diverse elements; it also refers to the act of putting parts together to form a whole or bringing pieces of information together to form a new meaning.
    Evaluation - Evaluation involves presenting and defending opinions by making judgments about information, the validity of ideas, or quality of work based on a set of criteria.

    This can be put as: receiving, responding, valuing, organizing, and characterizing.

There are different scenarios why we might be learning. Knowing why we are learning will help us decide whether we need an experts help or not. We can decide that based on how costly the mistake can be, how likely are we to make a mistake, or how easy it is to find an expert. Knowing scenarios for the lesson will help us decide what to learn.
Some scenarios are (We can imply Bloom's taxonomy on these scenarios.):
    solve a syntax level issue - knowledge
    find a method to make me more productive about a specific thing - comprehension/application
    find a specific question - knowledge/comprehension
    develop a new skill - application
    learn about a new technology if it's appropriate - comprehension/application/analysis
    required to learn by your manager - depending on request
    find a different job - depending on a job
    pass certification exam - depending on the exam, but around application
    learn because you want to know -  depending on us

We can use what we learned in different ways, such as being able to accomplish task or decide what technology to use.
    When deciding on what technology to use, there are steps:
        learn just enough to understand the general concept
        identify our needs
        learn about each option in terms of our needs
In order to accomplish a task, we need to do couple of steps:
    test concept in a plain environment
    integrate - both in code and in a journal
    learn how to implement new knowledge with a demo project
    come up with a simple project
    determine the differences between two
    get your project to work in a simple environment
    get a simple project to work in a work environment
    move your project
    create another "project" to make sure it can be repeated

There are couple ways how to make learning usable
    don't want to learn when applying
    differentiate between knowledge used every day and knowledge used only every so often
    It's important to know if the environment can give me what I need
    Be careful with complex answers
